# Highlighter: Real-Time Highlight Extraction

***`Highlighter`*** is a project designed to automatically extract real-time highlights from YouTube livestreams. Highlight timestamps are initially detected based on chat traffic surges, and these timestamps are then refined using context from video transcripts generated by Speech-to-Text (STT). This approach combines both audience reactions and content analysis for more accurate and meaningful highlight extraction. 

After extracting the highlights, ***`Highlighter`*** can automatically upload them back to YouTube for immediate sharing.

## Features

- **Real-Time Highlight Detection**: Automatically identifies potential highlight moments during YouTube livestreams by analyzing chat traffic spikes.
- **Contextual Highlight Refinement**: After detecting an initial highlight based on chat activity, ***`Highlighter`*** uses STT to generate transcripts from the video, refining the timestamp range of the highlight based on the content's context.
- **Seamless Automation**: The process of detecting, refining, and saving highlights is fully automated, requiring no manual intervention.
- **Highlight Saving**: Extracted highlights are stored on cloud storage for further review, editing, or sharing.
- **Automatic YouTube Upload**: Once highlights are extracted, videos are automatically uploaded to your YouTube account, making the highlights available for viewers almost instantly.
